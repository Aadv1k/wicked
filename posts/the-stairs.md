It was after about 6 minutes that I realised something was wrong; terribly wrong; I should start this off by telling you what brought me here, I've been taking stairs to get down my building as a new fitness fad for quite some time now, I usually put on some music on my headphones as I start my descent from the 18th floor, all seemed completely normal until I noticed that I was getting down the same floor again and again "A trick of mind" is what I tried to tell myself despite knowing there was something terribly wrong, "15th floor" the board strewn across the walls said again and again and again. "What is happening?" I stopped and retraced my steps back to the previous floor "15th floor" it said, A lump began to form on the back of my throat "Something isn't right" I thought, it was then the footsteps began, I heard someone descending down from what I presume to be the 18th floor, I listened intently hoping that someone would enter in this strange occurrence and maybe break the loop, I stood on the stairs waiting, as the lad appeared my heart skipped a beat, it was me, but there was something very wrong with everything about that creature, it felt as if it had put on a skin suit with my features upon it, its eyes felt cold as the skin on its face hung loosely, "No" I thought to my self and made a break for it that instant, descending down as fast as my legs could take me but alas "15th floor" again and again and again, I glanced at the window in front of the stairs and saw the reflection of the entity still following me, but in my hurry I hadn't noticed something, how each floor I descended, the 15th floor seemed to get smaller, first it was just a bulb, then it was a tube-light, as continued my descent into the fifth flight, the lights went away completely, I pulled out my mobile torch and continued my descent, I could hear the rapid footsteps of the being descending down the stairs at inhumane speeds, it was then that I broke my course and called the lift, "19th" it said, we did not have a 19th floor. As I called the lift, it instantaneously came down to 15th floor, as the doors opened, what met me sent a grisly feeling down my spine, one that a lost child feels inside of a mall -- Helplessness, "It was a wall" the lift doors opened up to a cold concrete wall, "No, no no no", I could hear the steps of the entity closing in, each floor consisted of two flats, one to the right of the stairs and the other to the left of the elevator, I ringed the bell of "1501" one right beside the lift. After standing there for what felt like an eternity, the door flew open, inside was what could only be described as blackness, my torch light too dim to pierce this sea of pure darkness, something about it didn't feel right and I backed off and start my descent again, yet again each floor I went down doors and elevators were replaced by concrete walls, until there were just the stairs left on each floor I went down, down, down and down I continued, my chest burnt, my knees felt light, my head hurt. But I continued. I continued and continued, until I couldn't. I let the entity catch me, and as I embraced something horrible to happen, it just passed me, and with a cold breeze that followed I was jolted awake on my bed "What a dream" I said as I got down, sweating from the nightmare I had just experienced. I quickly got dressed up for work, and opened my door, what I saw sent shudders down my spine, "19th" floor the board on above the lift said, we did not have a 19th floor, and as I was still in deep thought, the lights went away and I was immersed in darkness, I am writing this from my phone still unsure if I should take the lift or the stairs.
